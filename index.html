        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to St. Matthew the Evangelist Catholic School, we focus on the guiding principles that you seek in quality Catholic education: Excellence, Equity and Engagement. We offer 21st century learning, academic results, faith formation and a safe, caring community that accepts and respects your child. We continue to build our school community by introducing and developing further aspects of our school in collaboration with the Catholic School Council.

            At St. Matthew the Evangelist Catholic School, we offer education from Kindergarten to Grade 8. Find your local Catholic school and learn more about our admission requirement. Complete our online application to register your child for school.

            Parents/guardians, students, staff and the clergy are regarded as partners in the process of Catholic Education. I invite you to review our student agenda and become familiar with the information found in the agenda. A mutual understanding of our school routines and a clear definition of our expectations will form the basis of a positive relationship between the home and school.

            To all of our new families we welcome you to St. Matthew the Evangelist Catholic School! We look forward to working with you and your children as you become part of our exciting school community.</p>
